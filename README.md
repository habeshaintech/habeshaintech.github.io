## Welcome to Habesha in Tech club

As the global market moves into more tech-oriented businesses, Ethiopians & Eritreans are joining the tech world either through an academic path or making a career change.

We will invite guest speakers working in tech to share with us how they make their decision to join the tech, answer some questions from the audience and provide their advice on how to be successful in the field. 

The Language of discussions are 𝗔𝗺𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗰 or 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗵.

በቴክኖሎጂ የስራ ዘርፍ መሰማራት ይሻሉ? በቴክኖሎጂ ውስጥ የሚሰሩ ኢትዮጵያውያንና ኤርትራውያን የህይወት ተሞክሮ ማድመጥ ይፈልጋሉ? 

ወደዚህ ክለብ የምንጋብዛቸው እንግዶች በቴክኖሎጂ የሙያ ዘርፍ የተሰማሩና ልምድ ያላቸው ሲሆን ለያለፉበትን መንገድ እና የመረጡትን የሙያ ዘርፍ ያካፍሉናል። በተጨማሪም በተመረጡ የቴክኖሎጂ የሙያ ዘረፎች ላይ ያተኮረ ውይይት ይደረጋል።
